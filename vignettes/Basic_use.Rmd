The goal of this vignette is to describe the basic functions in the 
`HARtools` package.

## HAR format

HAR stands for HTTP Archive. This is a common format for recording HTTP 
tracing information. This file contains a variety of information. It has a 
record of each object being loaded by a browser. Each of these objectsâ€™ 
timings is recorded. The common extension for these files is .har.  The 
specification for this format is produced by the Web Performance Working
Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

An outline of the specification can be viewed at [softwareishard.com](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/)

## HARtools basics

`HARtools` is a lightweight package containing a number of tools to
read/parse, visualise and write files in the HAR format.

### Reading HAR files
`readHAR` is the function whoose aim is to read read/parse HAR objects. It
currently can read/parse a number of formats. It takes an argument `har` 
which currently can be a character string, an R list, a URL or a file
containing HAR data.

#### Reading/Parsing from file

The `HARtools` package contains a number of examples of HAR files. We will
use one of these (HAR data from browsing `google.com`):

```{r}
har <- readHAR(system.file(package = "HARtools", 
                           "exdata", "google.com.har"))
har
```
